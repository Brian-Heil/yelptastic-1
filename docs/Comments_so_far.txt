Comments so far:

Search Yelp
------------------------------
Logo and search boxes need to be spaced so that breadcrumb bar doesn't overextend results

Space out search results more

Search results rating isn't working

Search button in 'Search Yelp' should be a form, so enter works

Breadcrumb bar error: Home/Search/Search

Favorite button restyle

Remove tags in search results in 'Search Yelp'


Other

First-run should ask for username
