Comments so far:

Search Yelp
------------------------------
* Space out search results more
* Search button restyle
* Rename "Search Yelp" to "Add Favorite"
* Remove alerts
* When displaying error page, modify URL state
* If location box has data, and business is empty, we search and don't display an error.
* Spinner to show we're doing something when searching
* Instead of underlining all text when something is focused, just highlight the box.
* Not displaying location or distance
* When entering notes and tags, make boxes and labels horizontal instead of vertical.


Search Favorites
----------------------------------
* No indication that a result is selected when you hover mouse over it (link text doesn't have underlines)
* When search results show up, black border sometimes appears
* Cannot press enter to search, only Search button works

Other
--------------------------
* Breadcrumb bar error: Home/Lookup/Search/Lookup when you add bookmark, and then go to search for it.
* Breadcrumb bar error: Home/Search/Search
* First-run should ask for username - IGNORED


-----------------------------------------------------

TO DO

Implement filtering

Implement sorting - where it is on the page?
    Sort by rating, price, distance, date added to favorites

Favorites homepage when there are no favorites
