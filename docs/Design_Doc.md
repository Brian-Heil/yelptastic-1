## Overall Process

* Brainstorming
* Use Scenarios
* Look over feedback on use scenarios
* Start looking at different ways to visualize search results

## Roles and Responsibilities

We split the project into two parts: the back-end, which was concerned with querying the Yelp API and parsing the results, and the front-end, which took the data from the back-end and displayed it to the user.

Orlando and Dan worked on the front-end, while Jenee and Varun worked on the back-end. Varun worked on querying the Yelp API and writing functions to deal with geolocation, while Jenee worked on adding the API results to localstorage.

## Software Engineering

Yelptastic is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses many HTML5 features, like Local Storage, Geolocation, and the History API. Open-source components used in Yelptastic include:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org)
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com)
